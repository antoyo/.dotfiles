# To implement:
# Increment next number in line.
# Sessions.
# Save files for crash.
# Line wrapping (https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/136).
# Fuzzy search in results of a search command, not only in the file names.
# Highlight search results.
# Indenting (>) adds spaces on empty lines.
# Partial loading of config.
# Indent/unindent in insert mode (https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/334).
# 
# Possibly config:
# Allow <Space>q to exit even when the buffer does not represent a file on disk.
# Jump to next empty line.
# Search word under the cursor (instead of words containing the word under the selection).
# Global search of the word under the cursor.
# Remove completed text (by pressing ctrl-p, ctrl-n in cause you don't want any of the completions).
# Ctrl-d to continue scrolling at the end.
# Continue comment when pressing enter in insert mode.
# Case sensitive search (smart-case in next version).
